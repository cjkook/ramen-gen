## Ramen Generator
Welcome to my culinary-inspired art project tentatively named the 'Ramen Generator'. Each time the page is loaded a typical bowl of ramen is generated and then illustrated using the JavaScript library P5js. Variations in toppings, broth, dining utensils, and background are available.

In this current iteration only certain toppings in options are available. Future releases will add new toppings and certain elements of polish. 

v1.0 - Basic toppings and initial bowl generation. Each page refresh will generate a new bowl. Toppings included:
* Mushrooms
* Scallions
* Egg
* Black garlic oil
* Chicken broth
